# ML_Masters_Project by Matylda Hoffman

This branch contains two classification ML models in TensorFlow and Scikit Learn. They are trained on a large data set of simulated particle collisions of an electron-positron pair under FCC-ee conditions (240GeV centre-of-mass energy, 5e6 ab^-1 integrated luminosity), which then produce a higgs and Z bosons in their final state assuming the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). The aim of the project was identifying CP-symmetry violation in such decays via asymmetric distributions of kinematic and compound variables of a dileptonic decay of the Z.

- Data simulated using MadGraph 5 (Monte Carlo generation)
- Variable analysis and extraction done in Rivet (C++)
- Further analysis and ML analysis done using python scripts
